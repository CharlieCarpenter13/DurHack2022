# Learning Log.

## Entry one:

- This was written after DurHack but I accedently put my api keys on the public repo so I ended up deleating the fork. So I have inserted it below.

- Initially what I tried to do?

  - Learnt google maps API
  - Making api call from the server
  - Working as a team
  - Delagating ideas skills

- What you have learned

  - I have learned how to manage my google API keys
  - I also leaned how to call an API from a node js file using axios.
  - I aslo got a lot better at reading and understanding google API documentation.
  - One of the big things that I learnt was working as a team and how to deleigate diffrent tasks. Making it so that all our team can program at the same time.

- What I want to do know DurHack is over?

  - I want to make my own shortest parth algorthm this is becouse in our 24 hours we just used one that we found online.

  - I also want to try and sort out the look and overall feel of the website.

- What are my next steps?

  - To start looking into diffrent technices are finding the shortest paths.

  - I also want to look and document what formate the data would be passed to me and what sort of data I get. This is becouse I did not write the code that stores and gets the infomation from the database.
