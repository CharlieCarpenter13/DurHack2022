# Learning Log.

## Entry one:

- This was written after DurHack but I accedently put my api keys on the public repo so I ended up deleating the fork. So I have inserted it below.

- Initially what I tried to do?

  - Learnt google maps API
  - Making api call from the server
  - Working as a team
  - Delagating ideas skills

- What you have learned?

  - I have learned how to manage my google API keys

  - I also leaned how to call an API from a node js file using axios.

  - I aslo got a lot better at reading and understanding google API documentation.

  - One of the big things that I learnt was working as a team and how to deleigate diffrent tasks. Making it so that all our team can program at the same time.

  - I also learnt that the code that I write in a time pressure setting like a hackton can be very messy and hard to follow.  I feel like this might slow me down due in programing now becouse it will take me longer to program.

- What I want to do now DurHack is over?

  - I want to make my own shortest parth algorthm this is becouse in our 24 hours we just used one that we found online.

  - I also want to try and sort out the look and overall feel of the website.

- What are my next steps?

  - To start looking into diffrent technices are finding the shortest paths.

  - I also want to look and code and see what formate the data would be passed to me and what sort of data I get. This is becouse I did not write the code that stores and gets the infomation from the database.


## Entry two:
- What I have done?
  - Sinece my last log I have been ing diffrent technices for finding the shortest path that I want to impliment.
  - I have also been looking at the code we wrote in the hackton and trying to understand that.

- What have a learnt ?
  - I have learnt that the good way to store distances in a computer is using an adjesty matrix.
  - I have learnt and understood the sudo code for the implimentation of Dijkastas algorithm.
  - I have also been looking into diffrent exturnal libarys like matlab which from what I gather should be able to do what I want but I need to do further research before comming to program this.
  - I have also learnt that understanding and looking at other peoples code takes longer than I expected.  This has tourt me the importance of using comments in my code so that other people dont always have the same troubles that I had.


- Whats next?
  - I want to try and impliment the following three technices for finding the shortest path that I want to further look into are firtstly bruit forcing it, I want to do this just so that I practices handling the data sets. Secondly Dijkstra's algorithm which I will then impliment using the skills that I have learnt from the frist implimentation.  Finaly I then want to further explore and look at external libarys.
  
- Next steps?
  - Chaning the sudo code into working progarming code.

- program bruit force.
