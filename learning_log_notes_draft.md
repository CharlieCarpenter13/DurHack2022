# Learning Log.

## Entry one:

- This was written after DurHack but I accidently put my api keys on the public repo so I ended up deleting the fork. So I have inserted it below.

- Initially what I tried to do?

  - Learnt google maps API
  - Making API call from the server
  - Working as a team
  - Delegating ideas skills

- What have you learned?

  - I have learned how to manage my google API keys

  - I also learned how to call an API from a node js file using axios.

  - I also got a lot better at reading and understanding google API documentation.

  - One of the big things that I learnt was working as a team and how to deleigate diffrent tasks. Making it so that all our team can program at the same time.

  - I also learnt that the code that I write in a time pressure setting like a hackton can be very messy and hard to follow.  I feel like this might slow me down due in programing now becouse it will take me longer to program.

- What I want to do now DurHack is over?

  - I want to make my own shortest path algorithm this is because in our 24 hours we just used one that we found online.

  - I also want to try and sort out the look and overall feel of the website.

- What are my next steps?

  - To start looking into different techniques are finding the shortest paths.

  - I also want to look and code and see what format the data would be passed to me and what sort of data I get. This is because I did not write the code that stores and gets the information from the database.

## Entry two:
- What I have done?
  - Since my last log I have been trying different technices for finding the shortest path that I want to implement.
  - I have also been looking at the code we wrote in the hackathon and trying to understand that.

- What have a learnt ?
  - I have learnt that the good way to store distances in a computer is using an Adjacency matrix.
  - I have learnt and understood the pseudocode code for the implementation of Dijkastas algorithm but I have worked out that this is not aproprate for what I want to do.
  - I have also been looking into different external libraries like MATLAB which from what I gather should be able to do what I want but I need to do further research before coming to program this.
  - I have also learnt that understanding and looking at other people’s code takes longer than I expected.  This has taught me the importance of using comments in my code so that other people don’t always have the same troubles that I had.

- Whats next?
  - I want to firstly try and impliment the bruit force methode of finding the shortest path this will let me practice with the data types. Then I want to further explore and look at external libraries.
  
- Next steps?
  - Do more reseach into heruistic aproches on how to get a near enough fastest root. 
  - Look at the MATLAB documentation at how to input data and then what format it will return the data.


## Entry three

- talk about how the implimentation of the bruit force went
- talk about how finding the reasearch for heruistic aproches went and how i learnt more about them what is a herustic aproch


# Entry four

- Talk about how the implimentation of herusict aproch 
- Talk about implimentation libarys
- talk about how making a more structord plan next time to help keep motvated.


- foot notes:
  - program brute force.

  - using mat lab - https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/graph.distances.html
